# Self-triggered Online Monitoring
We propose a self-triggered online monitoring mechanism for signal temporal logic(STL) tasks. The paper titled "Sleep When Everything Looks Fine:
Self-Triggered Monitoring for Signal Temporal Logic Tasks" can be found in.

We provide two case studies to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithm: Drone altitude control and Spacecraft Rendezvous
All simulations were performed on a computer with an Intel Core i9-13900H CPU and 32 GB of RAM
